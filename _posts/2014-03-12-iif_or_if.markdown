![iif and if]({{ site.url }}/assets/2014-03-12_iif_and_if.png)

Just discovered this one yesterday. Not sure how I had not noticed for so long. Anyway...

```
iif( A, B, C ) 
```

is *not* equivalent to

```
if A then B else C end
```

The `iif` equivalent to `if A then B else C end` is

```
iif( A, B, C, C ) 
```

The third parameter is the value `iif` return is `A` is `false`. The fourth parameter is the value `iif` return if `A` cannot be evaluated (e.g. because of some null values).

With an `if A then B else C end`, the else parameter is returned if `A` is `false` or if `A` cannot be evaluated.
